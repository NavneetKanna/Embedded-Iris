# Embedded-Iris

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to our Embedded Lab course project! Our mission is to empower visually impaired individuals in their daily lives. We've designed a unique wearable device that combines Raspberry Pi 3, a camera, and a speaker to assist users with real-time object recognition and text-to-speech functionality.

Our device currently features OCR and object detection capabilities, which means that it can recognize objects and text in real-time. Imagine walking through a supermarket and having our device read out the name of each item you pass by. Or, being able to hear the names of signs and labels around you as you move through a busy street.

We're committed to making our device as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, with the goal of improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals. Thank you for your interest in our project!
