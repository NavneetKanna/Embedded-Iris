# Embedded-Iris

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to our course project for the Embedded Lab! Our goal is to improve the daily lives of people who are blind or visually impaired. We created a novel wearable that combines a Raspberry Pi 3, a camera, and a speaker to offer users text-to-speech functionality and real-time object identification.

Our device can presently recognise objects and text in real-time thanks to OCR and object detection technologies. Imagine using our technology to read out the names of each item you pass by as you browse a supermarket. Alternatively, hearing the titles of labels and signs surrounding you as you walk down a crowded street.

We're committed to make our product as simple and user-friendly as we can in order to enhance quality of life.
